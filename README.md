## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on the **automated detection of melanoma** (a severe type of skin cancer) from dermoscopic skin lesion images using **deep learning**.

- Initially, a **custom CNN architecture** was implemented for binary classification (malignant vs benign).
- While the CNN achieved reasonable accuracy, it lacked the generalization ability required for reliable medical diagnosis.
- To improve performance, we adopted **EfficientNetV2-L** (a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network) with transfer learning, which significantly boosted **validation accuracy and robustness**.

The objective is to build an **accurate, efficient, and scalable system** that can assist dermatologists in early melanoma screening.

## üöÄ Features
- Implementation of both **Custom CNN** and **EfficientNetV2-L** models.
- **Binary classification**: Malignant (Melanoma) vs Benign.
- **Data augmentation** for robustness in varying conditions.
- User-friendly interface for ease of use.
- Ability to work with multiple skin lesion image formats.
- Fast processing and high accuracy rates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements
To run the application smoothly, your system should meet the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or a Linux distribution.
- **RAM**: Minimum 8GB (16GB recommended).
- **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or equivalent.
- **Graphics Card**: Dedicated GPU is not required but recommended for faster processing.
- **Storage**: 1GB free space needed for installation.
